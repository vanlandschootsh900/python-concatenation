# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names



# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name



# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born



# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
