# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names
#first_name = 'charles'
#middle_name = ' james'
#last_name = " petoskey"
#print(first_name + middle_name + last_name + '.')

# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name
#player_name = input('players name:')
#print('welcome ' + player_name + ' to Space Invaders') 

# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born
#first_name = 'charles'
#last_name = " petoskey "
#birth_year = 2007
#print(first_name + last_name + "was born in " +str(birth_year) + '.')


# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
#country = 'chad'
#print('if money was no thing i would go to ' + country + '.')
